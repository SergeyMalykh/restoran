# Task requirements / (interview exam)

- ASSIGNMENTS! Please find below, and advise me when you think you can complete it by. Once completed, I would need to book
  in your onsite interview (1hr).<br/>
- The most common slip up, is that when the solution/code is run, the homepage for the Angular doesn’t look like the attached
  visual. Please ensure it looks like the attached visual. This is a Front end position, so the solution needs to be as close
  to identical as possible, and you have no time constraints for CSS Stylings etc..<br/>
- They are also looking for Angular best practices (components, etc..).<br/>
- I understand from the Hiring Manager it shouldn’t take more than a few hours to complete each exercise. Please add your completed
  assignments to a Github Repository and send me the links once completed.<br/>
- HTML5 and Angular 2+ A. Starting with index.html, create a homepage that look like the attached visual (visual.png), using
  Angular 2+, Bootstrap and CSS3. B. Add a row after “Meet our Culinary Specialists” that displays the restaurant’s menu
  in a grid. Demonstrate data binding to an array of JSON objects.<br/>
